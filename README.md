# 💻 Project

This is a small React Native app that can consume GitHub's API and created so I can get more familiar with React Native and its ecosystem.

## 🔧 Tools

This project was developed with the following tools:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Expo](https://expo.io/)

# 🏡 Running locally

1. Clone this repository;

2. Access its root directory and execute `yarn` to install all dependencies;

3. Execute `yarn android` to run the app on an android virtual device. The app was not tested on iOS environments. You could also connect to the Metro Bundler by scanning the QR Code with the Expo app on your phone.
